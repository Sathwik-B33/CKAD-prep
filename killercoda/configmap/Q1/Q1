Create a pod named redis-pod that uses the image redis:7 and exposes port 6379 .
Use the command redis-server /redis-master/redis.conf to store redis configuration data and store this in an emptyDir volume.

Mount the redis-config configmap data to the pod for use within the container.

Explanation:

first of all,
Use an initContainer when you see any of these patterns:

“Put config/data into an emptyDir”

If the question says:
	•	“store this in an emptyDir”
	•	“copy config”
	•	“generate a config file”
	•	“populate a directory”
	•	“create file before app starts”

•	Your Redis command is: redis-server /redis-master/redis.conf
•	But your ConfigMap has no key named redis.conf, only:
•	maxmemory
•	maxmemory-policy
•	So Redis can’t read those keys directly; it only knows how to read a redis.conf file.
•	Therefore we generate /redis-master/redis.conf first (using the ConfigMap values), then start Redis with it.

That’s exactly the point of the initContainer in the solution.

Because emptyDir is a shared volume in the Pod, not tied to a single container.

The lifecycle is like this:
	1.	Pod starts → emptyDir volume is created once (empty)
	2.	Init container runs first and writes:
	•	/redis-master/redis.conf (into the emptyDir)
	3.	Init container exits
	4.	Main container starts
	5.	Main container mounts the same emptyDir at /redis-master
	6.	The file is still there → Redis reads it
