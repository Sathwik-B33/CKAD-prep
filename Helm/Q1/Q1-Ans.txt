first,
-> kubectl create ns frontend-apd

Now, on the student-node node and go to the /opt/ directory. We have given the helm chart directory webapp-color-apd that contains templates, values files, and the chart file etc.

Update the values according to the given specifications as follows: -

a.) Update the value of the appVersion to 1.20.0 in the Chart.yaml file.

b.) Update the value of the replicaCount to 3 in the values.yaml file.

c.) Update the value of the type to NodePort in the values.yaml file.

These are the values we have to update.

Now, we will use the helm lint command to check the Helm chart because it can identify errors such as missing or misconfigured values, invalid YAML syntax, and deprecated APIs etc.


next,
cd /opt/

helm lint ./webapp-color-apd/

we will see something like this,

helm lint ./webapp-color-apd/
==> Linting ./webapp-color-apd/
[INFO] Chart.yaml: icon is recommended

1 chart(s) linted, 0 chart(s) failed

now, when we try install the helm chat by running the cmd:
helm install webapp-color-apd -n frontend-apd ./webapp-color-apd
we see an error because,
->Deployment apiVersion needs to be correctly written. It should be apiVersion: apps/v1.
->In the service YAML, there is a typo in the template variable {{ .Values.service.name }} because of that, it's not able to reference the value of the name field defined in the values.yaml file for the Kubernetes service that is being created or updated.

then try again, helm install webapp-color-apd -n frontend-apd ./webapp-color-apd

Use the helm ls command to list the release deployed using helm.
helm ls -n frontend-apd
