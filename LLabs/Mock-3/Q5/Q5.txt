In the ckad-pod-design namespace, we created a pod named custom-nginx that runs the nginx:1.17 image.

Take appropriate actions to update the index.html page of this NGINX container with below value instead of default NGINX welcome page:
"Welcome to CKAD mock exams!"

NOTE: By default NGINX web server default location is at /usr/share/nginx/html which is located on the default file system of the Linux.


Soln:

Exec to the pod container and update the index.html file content:
student-node ~ ➜kubectl exec -it -n ckad-pod-design custom-nginx -- sh
# echo 'Welcome to CKAD mock exams!' > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

Observe the result:
student-node ~ ➜  kubectl exec -it -n ckad-pod-design custom-nginx -- cat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
Welcome to CKAD mock exams!
