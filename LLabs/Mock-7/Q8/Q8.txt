One application, webpage-server-01, is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster by the Helm tool.
Now, the team wants to deploy a new version of the application by replacing the existing one. 
A new version of the helm chart is given in the /root/new-version directory on the student-node.
Validate the chart before installing it on the Kubernetes cluster. 


Use the helm command to validate and install the chart. After successfully installing the newer version, uninstall the older version. 

Soln:


In this task, we will use the helm commands. Here are the steps: -


Use the helm ls command to list the release deployed on the default namespace using helm.
helm ls -n default

First, validate the helm chart by using the helm lint command: -
cd /root/

helm lint ./new-version

Now, install the new version of the application by using the helm install command as follows: -
helm install --generate-name ./new-version

We haven't got any release name in the task, so we can generate the random name from the --generate-name option.

Finally, uninstall the old version of the application by using the helm uninstall command: -
helm uninstall webpage-server-01 -n default
