We have deployed an application in the green-space namespace. we also deployed the ingress controller and the ingress resource.


However, currently, the ingress controller is not working as expected. Inspect the ingress definitions and troubleshoot the issue so that the services are accessible as per the ingress resource definition.

Also, update the path for the app-wear-service to /app-wear and app-video-service to /app-video.


Note: You are allowed to edit or delete the resources related to ingress but do not change the pods.
