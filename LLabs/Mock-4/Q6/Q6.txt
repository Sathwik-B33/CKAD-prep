On the cluster1, the team has installed multiple helm charts on a different namespace. 
By mistake, those deployed resources include one of the vulnerable images called kodekloud/click-counter:latest.
Find out the release name and uninstall it.



Soln:



In this task, we will use the helm commands and jq tool. Here are the steps: -



Run the helm ls command with -A option to list the releases deployed on all the namespaces using helm.
->helm ls -A

We will use the jq tool to extract the image name from the deployments.
->kubectl get deploy -n <NAMESPACE> <DEPLOYMENT-NAME> -o json | jq -r '.spec.template.spec.containers[].image'

Replace <NAMESPACE> with the namespace and <DEPLOYMENT-NAME> with the deployment name, which we get from the previous commands.

After finding the kodekloud/click-counter:latest image, use the helm uninstall to remove the deployed chart that are using this vulnerable image.
->helm uninstall <RELEASE-NAME> -n <NAMESPACE>
